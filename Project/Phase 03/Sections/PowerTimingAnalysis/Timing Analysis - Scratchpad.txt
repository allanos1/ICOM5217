===================================
= Research - Minimum Pulse Width
===================================

Components:

• BMP085 - 3.4Mhz Max for I2C
| 
| Max: ~3.4 Mhz	
|
|

• Fan Sensor Speed Dependent on rotation.
|	- Worst Case:
|			Rotation speed in datasheets = 
|			4500 rpm @ 2 pulses per revolution 
|			= 9000 pulses per minute 
|			= 9000ppm/60 = 150pps max. = 150Hz
|	Max: 150Hz


• Bluetooth Module
| - To achieve UART Communication the clock is normally about 8, 16, 32, 64 times
|   the baud rate.
| - Baud Rate: 9600bps = 9600b/s = 9600 Hz
|	Established: 9.6Khz
|	- Max: 9.6 Khz * 8 = 76.8 Khz
| - Maximum Configurable Safe Baud: 921.6 Kbps
|	Resulting frequency ~ 1Mhz
|
| 	- Max: < 1 Mhz * 8 = 8 Mhz (But Tiva has not been tested for this baud rate)
|
|
| - TI does not yet have a Baud Rate error table compiled for the Tiva Microprocessor
| but has a Performance Limitation table that detailes the attainable and acceptable
| baud rate-clock combinations that deliver a successful UART communication. Maximum baud
| rate tested in this table is 115200bps, and the minimum clock frequency at which this
| baud is attainable for both Transmit and Receive according to the Performance Limitation
| table is 20 Mhz. [Reference]
| - This makes the clock rate greater than 64 times the baud rate 
| (115200 bps * 64 = ~ 7.4 Mhz)
| - Due to the limitation of the Baud Rate error table, the error that the clock causes
| on the baud rate cannot be shown here.


• LCD
| - The specifications inidicate that the MCU must correspond/conform to a 2Mhz bus interface.
| - Means the frequency for interfacing is 2Mhz. It can be slower than this however.
| - 1/(2Mhz)= 0.5 us 
| 		Max: 2Mhz
|


• Humidity and Temperature Sensor
| - 18ms Start Signal ACK
| - 20-40us MCU Pull Up Voltage ACK
| 	- 80 us low-v-level response signal.
|	- 80 us high-v-level preparation signal.
|		- 50 us 	low-v-level means start bit transmit.
|		- 26-28 us	high-v-level is 0.
|		- 70 us 	high-v-level is 1.
|			- 50 us		low-v-level means end.
|
| For Fastest Operation we would need:
| 	20 us
| 	f = 1/20us = 1/(2x10^-7) = 50Khz


Hence the worst-case minimum pulse width is: 50ns
Source: Tiva w/ Bluetooth Module @ 115.2 Kbps Baud 
			-> 20 Mhz Frequency
Processor must have a minimum frequency of:
	20 Mhz < 80Mhz = Tiva Frequency


A functional minimum pulse width
Source: Tiva w/ Bluetooth Module @ 9.6 Kbps Baud 
			-> 8 Mhz Frequency
This forces the processor to have a minimum frequency of:
	8 Mhz <  80Mhz = Tiva Frequency
