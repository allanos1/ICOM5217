\section{Design Criteria}
	
	\subsection{System Precision and Range}

    	The system needs to be precise in the measurements performed while running the aerodynamic experiments against the objects as they can vary in weight in different orders. According to the director, Dr. Raul Zapata, the measurement precision performed in the current version of the scale is in the order of hundreds of pounds (approximately 0.02 pounds or 10 grams). This could be over a range of 0 to 15-20 pounds.

	\subsection{System Safety}

   		The system will be used in an environment for testing aerodynamics, particularly in the wind tunnel located in the Civil Engineering building at the University of Puerto Rico at Mayaguez. The location of the current system is below the tunnel and it is attached to it (bolted). The current proposed design of the system involves using a static mechanical system that requires no movement and this is an improvement over the current design. It requires no intervention from the user contrary to the present one. In the present one, should the mechanical component of the object fail while performing the experiment it can damage the components or cause damage to the experimenter. Since no manual intervention is required in the proposed system, an improvement is provided in terms of safety.
