\section{Operating Chart}
	For the operating chart, we determined the sequence of steps that the system goes through to perform its functionality. 
	The set of procedures can be \emph{summarized} as general phase, a calibration procedure, a wind speed checker procedure, and a bluetooth communication procedure. In the end we obtained the following procedures:
