	Wind tunnels are used for research in various areas of science and engineering, such as wind 
	and aerodynamics. The wind tunnel of the University of Puerto Rico, Mayag\"{u}ez Campus 
	is overly outdated, and recording data using it can be inconvenient due to old technologies used in it. We propose 
	AeroBal, a system that would improve the current wind tunnel in an important 
	way, adding sensors and motors, among other things. AeroBal would make recording data much simpler than it currently is, and 
	could help make research easier in the future for constant users of the tunnel, such as mechanical and civil engineering students.
