\section{Market Description}
	The proposed system is designed to enhance balancing systems used in wind tunnels, and thus has a targeted market of organizations or individuals who want to enhance the precision or data collection on their wind tunnels. The system is a fixed system which must be installed on the wind tunnel itself and powered electrically. By using strain gauge sensors it measures the forces exerted by the object and obtains necessary data without actually moving. It replaces an old and very manual system using sand as weights which must be balanced by hand then be weighed on a scale to know the amount and adds human error, affecting precision.\\

	There is currently no general commercial solution for a self built wind tunnel like this. Since wind tunnels are built in different ways with different sizes and power available, the systems used for measurements can be different and in turn are developed by the makers of the wind tunnel. Different implementations exist ranging from optical systems  to reduce friction \cite{ref:market1} to static systems measuring force \cite{ref:market2} like the one being implemented. Commercial wind tunnel vendors may include their own version for their wind tunnels which may not be adaptable or cost efficient for self-made wind tunnels. This makes our project useful for any wind tunnel which uses a similar rod balancing system for measurements on the object inside, which would enhance precision and the speed of data collection.
