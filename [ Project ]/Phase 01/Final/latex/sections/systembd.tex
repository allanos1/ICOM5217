\section{System Block Diagram}


	The system will be reading data from the accelerometers and gyroscopes, which will be used as tilt sensors, to know if the balance is positioned correctly for initial setup. Once in the correct position and the wind tunnel started, the system will then use the force sensors to read how much force is being applied to keep the object in its original position.
